## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **responsive and visually appealing Real Madrid CF fan webpage** developed using **pure HTML and internal CSS**. The webpage is designed to showcase the club’s rich history, iconic stadium, legendary players, major trophies, and a sample current squad in a structured and user-friendly layout.

The page features a **modern UI design** with a gradient header, smooth navigation bar, and a full-width hero banner using the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium image. Each section is clearly organized using semantic HTML elements such as `header`, `nav`, `section`, and `footer`, ensuring readability and maintainability.

Key highlights include:

* **Custom CSS styling** for consistent color themes inspired by Real Madrid’s identity
* **Flexbox layout** for responsive image alignment
* **High-quality images** to enhance visual engagement
* **Tabular representation** of player information for clarity
* **Hover effects and shadows** to improve user experience

This project is ideal for **educational purposes**, front-end practice, and as a foundation for building more advanced football or sports-themed websites. It demonstrates fundamental web development concepts such as layout design, styling, responsiveness, and content organization without relying on external libraries or frameworks.
